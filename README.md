hi i'm poppet. i like terraria Especially the bosses. don;t expect much npc stuff from me aside from like... my guide pony </br>
i also like hermitcraft & cattails but i like terraria the most if it isn't obvious #ProudTerrarian </br>
system. also i'm autistic & a narcissist (+ more) all of this affects how i interact with people so be careful please

i struggle with typing & am not that interested in talking to people, but if you want to then whispering me is your best bet. </br>
^ unless i have like, 'int' in my pony name. terraria fans please say hi :pray: i am normal about this game i promise! </br>
do terraria fans even exist on pony town. Also i don't really care for calamity i only know like the exo mechs

i get pelted with rocks every day at 11 am by the way. they have to keep me in check </br>
to people who demonize cluster b disorders: fuck off & eat shit. i do not like you.! </br>
also basic dni i guess??????? i could really care less but whatever
