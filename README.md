hi i'm poppet. i like terraria Especially the bosses. don;t expect much npc stuff from me aside from like 2 ponies </br>
system. also i'm autistic & a narcissist (+ more) all of this affects how i interact with people so be careful please

i struggle with typing & am not that interested in talking to people, but if you want to then whispering me is your best bet. </br>
^ unless i have like, 'int' in my pony name. terraria fans please say hi :pray: (i don't care for calamity sorry guys)

i get pelted with rocks every day at 11 am by the way. they have to keep me in check
